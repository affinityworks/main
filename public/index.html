<p>The advocacy commons is a project to build a platform for sharing and collaboration between local social movement groups and national networks.</p>

<p>The advocacy commons is an open source advocacy platform built on the <a href="http://opensupporter.org/">Open Supporter - OSDI standard</a> with a focus on connecting local organizers with national campaign organizations.</p>

          <h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Local groups don’t have either the technical ability to build advocacy tools nor the ability to reach into the membership lists of national groups. The coordination costs between local and national campaigns is high.</p>

<p>National groups need to protect and grow their membership lists while cultivating trusted local partners to do coordinated campaigning. This allows national groups to build lists, share outreach with local groups, activate campaigns, while protecting the fundraising and contact channel with their members by acting as a passthrough for outreach.</p>

<p>We face a problem not to different from what airbnb faced. How to find local people who you can trust and work with. In this case it’s around social movements and organizing, vs a place to stay. This platform helps connect national groups with organizers who are good and organizers with national campaigns coordination, lists, and resources.</p>

          <h4>The Solution</h4>
<p>Build a platform for discovery, collaboration, and safe data sharing between organizations. Take existing social practices of movement building and collaboration and give it a ‘sharing economy’ style platform for it to happen easily.</p>

<p>The lifeblood of organizing is the contact list. Advocacy Commons is a tool for local organizers and a platform to connect them to national networks for coordinated action.</p>

          <p>The Trump presidency presents us with a chance to build a broad coalition of groups fighting for an inclusive humane society.</p>

<p>Starting with the senate confirmation process we’ve got what will be 4 long years of a Trump administration. We need to develop stronger alliances and new forms of organizing to fight for a society of inclusion and environmental sustainability.</p>

<h1 class="text-purple">We want to work with others and learn.</h1>

<p>We’re focused on running code and agile collaboration. We have a lot to learn and are open to hearing from you. The application is far from usable, but <a href="https://github.com/advocacycommons/">the code is open</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve got a very light traffic slack channel which you can join at <a href="https://advocacycommons-slackin.herokuapp.com/">advoacacycommons.slack.com</a></p>
