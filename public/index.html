  <div class="intro"><p>
    The country is on fire with activist groups resisting the emerging <span class="hilight">threats to American democracy</span>. It's inspiring and exciting, but some activists tell us it's also challenging to manage all those people and actions!</p>
    <p>Affinity.works is a team of veteran activist-coders who are making <span class="hilight">open-source tools to solve current grassroots organizing problems</span>.  We envision a more connected, efficient and flexible organizing world, where responsive, intersectional coalitions can more easily form and collaborate.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="about"><h3>Solving current problems for grassroots organizers</h3>
    <div class="subtitle">
      <p>
      <span class="hilight">There is no simple technological solution to social problems,</span> but social movements can use technology to manage their day-to-day work and magnify their impact &ndash; especially when that tech is <span class="hilight">responsive to the actual needs of actual organizers.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      We come to this project with decades of organizing experience from digital to grassroots. We also know that the new social
      movements need tools which reflect the reality of how they work and help them be more effective. Affinity uses design thinking and lean techniques in partnership with organizers to identify and solve concrete problems.
